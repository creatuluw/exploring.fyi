@lib/ i want you to redesign and re-implement the flow and logic of the ai, content, presentation, sequencing according to the descriptions and criteria in @app-flow.md 

Do deep research for all these adjustments and make sure to understand what we need.

Break down this request into atomic tasks with clear descriptions of what to do. 

Also clean up @tasks.md and delete any unfinished task, keep only finished tasks, and delete any content that isnt a task from this document.

After that add all the atomic tasks from above to @tasks.md at the end of the list and lets then approve the list before we start working.

Lastly, when approved, you'll pickup one after the other while after every step these is a result that can be seen and tested by the user.
